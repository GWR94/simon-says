# Simon Says

A simon says game, built with React and TypeScript, with differing speeds based on progress
in game. Includes an option for "strict mode" where one fail resets the whole game, or alternatively
you can fail as many times as you like without the score resetting.

## Installation

To install the game, run `git clone https://github.com/jamesgower/simon-says` or download the
zip file, and navigate into the folder.

## Usage

To run the game, install the files with `npm install` and run `npm run start` to start the
development server. The game can then be found by going to localhost:8080 in any browser.

Alternatively the game can be accessed by going to [this](https://www.james-gower.dev/simon-says) link.

For testing/debugging purposes, the current chain of colours is logged into the console.
